## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

To create a responsive and functional porftolio page to showcase projects for future employers.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

I built this project so that if an employer is considering hiring me they can look at previous work I have completed that showcase my skills as a developer.

- What problem does it solve?

If an employer wants to see my work, rather than going through github or going through an interview to determine what skills i possess or how valuable i could be to their team, they can view my portfolio and determine if i would be a worthy candidate for an interview.

- What did you learn?

I learned the fundementals of HTML, CSS, and responsive design for modern webpages.
